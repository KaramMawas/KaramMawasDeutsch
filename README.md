## Work Experience
**Quality control of additively manufactured building components @ IGP, TU-BS (_May 2020 - Present_)**
- Developing an automated data capturing approach for TLS in the production printing lab.
- Comparing registration approaches between direct **co-registration** and **ICP-based** methods, emphasizing their distinctions.
- Innovating **computer vision and deep learning** methods for quality control of printing objects as well as the filaments of the object, with a focus on SC3DP and Extrusion base during production.
- Conducting comprehensive research on the current state of **quality control** for concrete 3D printed specimens and the corresponding sensor technology in use.


**Vermessung Engineer @ Eagle Eye Technologies, Berlin (_May 2017 - May 2020_)**
- Implement Kalman filtering for post-processing **navigation data**
- Calibrate sensors for optimal performance
- Analyze and document road conditions through **evaluation of scan data and images**, 
actively contributing to maintenance concept development and city mapping generation.
